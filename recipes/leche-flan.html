    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>½ cup granulated sugar(100 g)</li>
      <li>12 large egg yolks</li>
      <li>1 can sweetened condensed milk, 14 ounce (395 G)</li>
      <li>340 g evaporated milk(340 g)</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon lemon extract</li>
      <li>6 cups boiling water(1.4 L), for water bath</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).</li>
      <li>
        Heat a medium skillet over medium-low heat. Add the granulated sugar and
        cook, stirring occasionally, until the sugar melts into an amber-colored
        caramel, 5-6 minutes. Reduce the heat to low and stir until the sugar is
        fully melted. Remove the pan from the heat and carefully pour the
        caramel into a 9 x 5-inch (22x12 cm) loaf pan. Let the caramel cool for
        5 minutes while you make the custard.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the egg yolks and condensed milk to a large bowl and whisk to
        combine, then add the evaporated milk and lemon extract and whisk to
        incorporate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the custard into the pan with the caramel. Cover the pan with foil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Set the loaf pan in a 9 x 13-inch (22x33 cm) baking dish and carefully
        pour the boiling water into the baking dish, taking care not to splash
        any into the flan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Carefully transfer to the oven and bake for 35-40 minutes, until the
        flan is fully set.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the flan from the oven, lift the loaf pan from the water bath,
        and let cool to room temperature, then refrigerate for overnight.
      </li>
      <li>
        When ready to serve, run a knife around the edges of the pan to loosen
        the flan, then invert onto a platter, slice, and serve.
      </li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
